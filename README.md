# GitHub-Source-Anomaly-Detection

## Overview
Source Code Anomaly Detection (SCAD) is a software solution developed for analyzing source code repositories and detecting anomalies, particularly focusing on identifying malware presence. It utilizes z-scores as a training feature and advanced algorithms for accurate anomaly detection.

## Key Features
- Analyzes source code repositories to detect anomalies.
- Utilizes z-scores as a training feature for anomaly detection.
- Incorporates advanced algorithms for accurate anomaly identification.
- Focuses on identifying malware presence within source code.
- Provides detailed reports on detected anomalies and potential threats.

## How to Use
1. Upload source code repositories to the SCAD interface.
2. Configure parameters and thresholds for anomaly detection.
3. Run the analysis to detect anomalies, particularly malware presence.
4. Review the detailed reports and take necessary actions to mitigate threats.

## Technologies Used
- Programming Languages: [ Python]
- Tools/APIs: NONE

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with additional anomaly detection techniques.
- Enhanced visualization of analysis results.
- Real-time monitoring and notifications for detected anomalies.
- Integration with security platforms for automated threat response.
